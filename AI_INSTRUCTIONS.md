waw is a minimal Node.js (>= v24) modular platform where a project is composed of independent modules located under /server/<moduleName>. The core framework is intentionally small and is responsible only for discovering local modules (from config.server or "server") and required global modules (from the globally installed waw package), installing module dependencies synchronously per module from module.json, ordering modules using declarative before/after rules (with "*" support, cycle-avoidance, stable topo ordering, and a priority-based fallback on cycles), executing CLI commands exposed exclusively via files named exactly `cli.js` (resolved from last module to first so later modules override earlier ones), and bootstrapping the runtime by sequentially loading each module’s `index.js` when no CLI command is handled (awaiting it if it exports a function). Modules are self-contained units defined by module.json, may declare dependencies and ordering constraints, and receive a small, stable waw execution context exposing argv, merged config, projectType, key paths (projectPath/modulesPath/wawPath and related config paths), and tiny fs helpers for reading/writing files and JSON. The core does not define application behavior, frameworks, routing, databases, or generators — all functionality is provided by modules.
