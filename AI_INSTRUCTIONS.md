waw is a minimal Node.js (>= v24) modular platform where a project is composed of independent modules located under `/server/<moduleName>`. The core is intentionally small and is responsible only for discovering local modules (from `config.server` or `"server"`) and required global modules (from the globally installed `waw` package), installing module dependencies synchronously per module from `module.json`, ordering modules using declarative `before`/`after` rules (with `"*"` support, cycle-avoidance, stable topo ordering, and a priority-based fallback on cycles), executing CLI commands exposed exclusively via files named exactly `cli.js` (resolved from last module to first so later modules override earlier ones), and bootstrapping the runtime by sequentially loading each module’s `index.js` when no CLI command is handled (awaiting it if it exports a function). Modules are self-contained units defined by `module.json`, may declare dependencies and ordering constraints, and receive a small, stable waw execution context exposing `argv`, merged `config`, `projectType`, key paths (`projectPath`, `modulesPath`, `wawPath` and related config paths), and tiny fs helpers for reading/writing files and JSON. The context also includes `waw.terminal` (moved into the waw framework): an interactive CLI helper built on Node’s `readline/promises` that provides `ask(question, { defaultValue, required, validate, transform })`, `confirm(question, { defaultValue })`, and `choose(title, options, { prompt, defaultIndex, showNumbers, allowCancel, cancelLabel })`, plus an optional spinner (`spinnerStart(text)`, `spinnerUpdate(text)`, `spinnerStop(finalText)`) and clean SIGINT handling; use it in any `cli.js` by calling `const t = waw.terminal();` then `await t.ask(...)` / `await t.choose(...)` / `await t.confirm(...)`, and finally `t.close()` when done. The core does not define application behavior, frameworks, routing, databases, or generators — all functionality is provided by modules.
