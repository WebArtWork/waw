waw is a minimal Node.js (>= v24) modular platform where a project is composed of independent modules located under /server/<moduleName>. The core framework is intentionally small and is responsible only for discovering local and global modules, installing module dependencies synchronously per module, ordering modules using declarative before/after rules (with "*" support and stable fallback), executing CLI commands exposed exclusively via cli.js files (resolved from last module to first, allowing overrides), and bootstrapping the runtime by loading each module’s index.js when no CLI command is handled. Modules are self-contained units defined by module.json, may declare dependencies and ordering constraints, and receive a small, stable waw execution context exposing paths, arguments, and module metadata. The core does not define application behavior, frameworks, routing, databases, or generators — all functionality is provided by modules.
